<p> This revolution is all because of the capitol. They treat us like their own personal slaves. we farm for them, clean, and creat their electricity. We do everthing for them, while they dont lift a finger. It's time for a change. We need to rise up and claim what is ours. It's time for us to be treated like human beings. We have need to rise from the ashes, band together. It IS TIME FOR A REVOLUTION</p>
